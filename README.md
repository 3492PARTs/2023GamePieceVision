## 2023GamePieceVision
# Ongoing Project!
2023 FRC vision to predict game pieces from a camera and manipulate them to find the distance and rotation from them.

**You will need to download the following dependancies:**
- Keras (`pip install keras`)
- numpy (`pip install numpy`)
- opencv (`pip install opencv-python`)
- tensorflow (https://youtu.be/3ESKiJKzZwE for a tutorial, it is very hard to install without watching the video first)

once all dependancies are installed, you can start by running the `vision.py` file.
