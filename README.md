# 2023GamePieceVision
## Ongoing Project!

2023 FRC vision program to predict game pieces from a camera and manipulate the video to find the distance and rotation from them.
Built using Teachable Machine and GRIP.

**You will need to download the following dependancies for the software to run:**
- Keras (`pip install keras`)
- Numpy (`pip install numpy`)
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
- Tensorflow (https://youtu.be/3ESKiJKzZwE for a tutorial, it is very hard to install without watching the video first)

Once all dependancies are installed, you can start by running the `vision.py` file.
